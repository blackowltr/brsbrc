I am a student and I am also interested in web3. I am a person trying to contribute to projects by working in this field.

I am intertwined with technology due to my job. I am interested in Blockchain and I follow the development of Web3 with interest.

I hope to be able to support you during the testing of your project because I have participated in testnets of many different projects and actively run a validator or node operator.

For example;

Aptos, Sei, Stride, Quicksilver, Massa, Bundlr, Nibiru, Lava, Shardeum, Sui, Babylon, StaFi...

To talk about myself a little more;

I am also one of the managers of the Turkish society in the NuLink Project. Also, I am a NuLink ambassador.

I am also the discord turkey moderator of the stride project and I have an ambassador role in the Nitro Labs project.

I manage the Turkey Twitter accounts of Stride and Nitro projects.
